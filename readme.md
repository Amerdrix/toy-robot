# Toy Robot

This is a toy robot simulation.

The simulation consists of a table top, and a robot. The robot can freely move around the table (no obstructions) in as many as **four** directions.

The robot can be placed (by a god figure, aka the user) at any point. Rather obviously, the robot cannot move until it has been placed on the table. Powered by an uber sophisticated AI engine, the robot will not allow its self to move off the table.
